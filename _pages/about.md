## ~# whoami
Student of infosec, the world, and the bottom of a fine whiskey bottle.
After enjoying (griinnnding) a near decade long stint in IT, I decided to borrow a close friend's book on pentesting. 
I was immediately addicted to thrill of learning, and 12 months later obtained an OSCP.
Shortly after I was exposed to the Australian infosec community, and was blown away by how open,helpful, and friendly they were as whole compared to the culture of IT support "proffesionals".
I decided that regardless of whether or not I were to gain employment in this ever changing, ever *humbling* environment, that would continue to study it in all it's aspects.
My next large target is the [OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/ctp-osce/), in order to prepare for this I have decided to pursue [SLAE32](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=3).
My goal is to help, teach, and/or inspire anyone else wanting to obtain hard cyber skills with no previous knowledge or exposure or connections.
