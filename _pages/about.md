**Student of infosec, the world, and the bottom of a fine whiskey bottle.**

After enjoying (griinnnding) a near decade long stint in IT, I was starting to get a bit over "IT". A close friend of mine lent me a book on pentesting, and ecouraged me to try my hand. 
I was immediately addicted to thrill of learning, and 12 months later obtained an [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/).

Shortly after I was exposed to the Australian infosec community, and was blown away by how open, helpful, and friendly they were as a whole compared to the culture of IT support "professionals".

I decided that regardless of whether or not I were to gain employment in this ever changing, ever *humbling* environment, that I would continue to study it in all it's aspects.

My next large target is the [OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/ctp-osce/), in order to prepare for this I have decided to pursue [SLAE32](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=3).

My goal is to help, share knowledge with, and/or inspire anyone else wanting to obtain hard cyber skills with no previous knowledge or exposure or connections.
