# It's been a hot minute, and I am sure no one reads these - but it is important for me to reflect on what has been so I know where to go...

__This post will be broken up into three parts:__  
  * a brief synopsis of how I got here from where I was
  * What a SysAdmin (in my opinion) needs to do in order to be competitive as a pentester.
  * An insight look at an actual pentesting scenario 


### To quickly summarise my exposure to IT before pivoting to Sec...
...I have close to 10 years under my belt - which may SEEM like a lot, however most of the time was spent on Helpdesk, incident management and pressing buttons in a sequence to patch large scale environments. Only 3 of those years were spent accumulating hard technical skills, when I landed what I would actually call my first _real_ job in IT as a Network Technician. This job, after 7 years finally ignited my passion for tech, up until then it was "just a job" and I was always looking for something better. (Thank you Michael AKA BIG MICK)

During those three years I quickly progressed to being a System Engineer at another company, and shortly after was contracted out to do SysAdmin work at an Airport, where I learnt A LOT. 
I genuinely believe that the reason I progressed so fast was because I was studying for my [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/) alongside this work period, this is a whole separate point of discussion and I already have a writeup [HERE](https://kymb0.github.io/zero-2-OSCP/), which includes a more detailed breakdown of all the stuff I just rambled on about.

## So let's begin

Towards the tail end of my OSCP attempts, I could feel that it would not be long until I passed. That, coupled with dissatisfaction with my current employer led me to start scoping out Junior Security roles. 
Now this, is where it gets interesting.
There seems to be some perpetual cycle where many places do not want to hire Juniors, as it cost money to dedicate seniors to help them NOT be juniors.
But no one wants to employ juniors... so the market is therefore starved for seniors... So the only option is to hire juniors... But there are not enough seniors to train the juniors...
And thus I realised that to get into this industry, it was going to take more than simply handing out CV's that said "ME ALMOST HAVE OSCP, ME KNOW HOW 2 HAK PLS HIRE ME"
And so I got in touch with recruiter who is an absolute legit legend of a bloke (whose name/company I will not put in here unless he permits it).
Although this guy did not get me my first job in Sec _directly_ and would not have had a chance to work for the company I am at now if it wasn't for this guy.

Initially, as I did not yet have my OSCP yet meant getting interviews was tough for the recruiter, something he was honest about. Nevertheless he did try, but it wasn't until I finally passed that he was able to get an interview at a rather large company. By this time I also had my blog going (mainly for the purpose of submitting [SLAE32](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/course?id=3) assignments) which also made me slightly competitive as a junior candidate. I completed 2 rounds successfully (according to feedback was at offer stage) however due to a merger/covid, recruitment (for Juniors) was frozen. The fact I was able to secure an interview in the first place was confidence-boosting however, and it also gave me an opportunity to be invited to the [sectalks](https://www.sectalks.org/) slack group - something I was not even aware existed.

During the 8 or so months it took to hear back from the larger company, I continued to work on my blog, upskill via any online resource I could find (will link at end of this post), engage actively with the community via entering study groups and posting my blogs, and participating in CTFs.  
All of these steps were crucial to giving me the exposure, inside knowledge, skills, and connections needed to both secure and pass the interview for my first pentesting job.
Funnily enough around the same time this opportunity came up, the ORIGINAL company now fully merged requested a final interview, which I felt I did quite well at however they could not go through with the offer due to my lack of experience(?)

As things are meant to be however, the company I work for now was more than happy to bring me onboard for a rather large and complex long term project after just one interview. Now, I think it is important to consider that it really was not just the hours worth of time that I put in during this one interview, this was simply the final piece of 8 months of hard, focused work. I cannot stress the importance of community engagement enough - even if you lurk in any chats or forums you can find - you WILL learn.
