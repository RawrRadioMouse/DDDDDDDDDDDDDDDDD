#### I am sure better bypasses will come along shortly, but for now if you Wanna post about the latest croc attack but Uncle Zucc got you down, follow the below!


  * Go to: [https://webhook.site/](https://webhook.site/)
  * In the top right hand corner and select `edit`  
  * Change the content type to `text/html`  
  * In response body put: `<body onload=window.location='YOURLINKHERE'>`  

Now copy your unique URL and share! Possibly with a screencap of what the site should look like when it loads, as link preview will not work.

## TA-DA - how exciting!!

__I will put a detailed explaination of what webhooks are here at some stage__



On another note - during the 15 minutes I spent on this very poor post I read the word *_"NEWS"_* too many times and now it makes no sense when I look at it.
