#### I am sure better bypasses will come along shortly, but for now if you simply MUST link to that latest Ugg boot design or that latest Vegemite label design, follow the below.


  * Go to: https://webhook.site/  
  * In the top right hand corner and select edit  
  * Change the content type to text/html  
  * In response body put: <body onload=window.location='YOURLINKHERE'>  

Now copy your unique URL and share! Possibly with a screencap of what the site should look like when it loads, as link preview will not work.

__I will put a detailed explaination of what webhooks are here at some stage__
