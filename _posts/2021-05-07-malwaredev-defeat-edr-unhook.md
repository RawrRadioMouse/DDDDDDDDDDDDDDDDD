* _My malware study notes are available [here](https://github.com/kymb0/Malware_learns)_  

### As a follow up to my previous [blog post](https://kymb0.github.io/malwaredev-bypass-av-xml/) where Defender was bypassed, I decided to challenge myself by approaching a more mature AV solution. And so I googled "enterprise grade EDR", signed up for a 30 day trial, and installed it (The name of the product will NOT be revealed in this blog or at any point in the future).  

![EDR](/assets/images/malware_2/edr_settings.png)  

I decided to stick with the previous theme, and expand upon the previously written .xml shellcode runner generator to include whichever techniques would be needed to bypass the EDR. Which at this point, I was still quite naive about. In fact - I half expected that I would simply add an AMSI bypass to it and call it a day...  

Oh how wrong I was.  

![wwwaaaaahhhttt??!](/assets/images/malware_2/shocking_realisation.gif)  

After employing all the techniques I had previously learnt aswell as a technique to patch amsiScanBuffer in memory it was clear I had much more research to do.  

Now, when it comes to Windows OS privileges there are two main modes: [Kernel](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-a-kernel)-Mode (where device drivers and the kernel run) and User-mode (where installed applications run).  

Due to mechanisms that protect the kernel, EDRs can not monitor in Kernel-mode. They can however monitor the very last calls made before the OS switches to kernel mode, these calls are made from `ntdll.dll` as syscalls. So any function call made from say, `kernel32.dll` or `user32.dll` will end up resolving back to ntdll.dll.  

With this in mind, it makes sense that EDR solutions would want to "hook" into this dll to make sure there is no funny business going on. This is achieved by injecting a vendor dll into each process, and can be easily confirmed by dissasembling a function call within `ntdll` and viewing the JMP instruction which redirects execution into the injected vendors dll.  

![hookON/hookOFF](/assets/images/malware_2/hooked_vs_unhooked.png)  

We can get around this using a technique called "manual mapping", this technique and more complex variants of it are covered well [here](https://s3cur3th1ssh1t.github.io/A-tale-of-EDR-bypass-methods/).  

At a high level, what we are doing is manually loading the source `ntdll.dll` file from the native Windows directory into memory, getting a handle to the currently loaded `ntdll` (hooked) and redirecting this to our fresh copy (unhooked, as it has been loaded directly from disk). A deep dive into this process has been covered in [makosec's blog](https://makosecblog.com/malware-dev/dll-unhooking-csharp/)  

Once again we rely upon the fantastic [P/Invoke](http://pinvoke.net/default.aspx/Structures.IMAGE_DOS_HEADER) site as a resource to base our code off, and after comparing a simple Hello World program with the unhook program vs one without, we can see that the unhooked program no longer jumps to the vendor's dll. Perfect!  

After much trial, error, and totally n00b tier mistakes I had finally "Frankensteined" together a template containing my [EDR](https://github.com/kymb0/Malware_learns/blob/main/templates/edr_unhook_manual_mapping.cs),[AMSI](https://github.com/kymb0/Malware_learns/blob/main/templates/amsi_bypass.cs), and [Shellcode_runner](https://github.com/kymb0/Malware_learns/blob/main/templates/shellcode_runner.cs) that would dynamically spit out `.xml` files to be compiled and ran with `MSbuild.exe`. It takes a file containing raw shellcode as a file and encrypts it and the strings required to pull functions from dlls in memory.  

![generate_xml](/assets/images/malware_2/generate_script.png)  

It was detected! During the MSbuild compilation there was a temp dll written to disk which was flagged as a [PUA](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/the-weaponization-of-puas)(Potentially Unwated Application). This seemed to be triggered by some sort of static analysis, ten I realised that I had not yet reduced the [IAT](https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/import-adress-table-iat-hooking)(Import address Table - basically a section of a program which lists imported functions). So I got to work, making use of a technique I had used in my first project where [delegates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/delegates/) were used wherever possible so that rather than functions being imported at compilation, there are referenced at runtime.  

With all this done, I was excited to recieve my first shell from my tool!  

![run_shellcode](/assets/images/malware_2/run_shellcode.png)  

![basic_shell](/assets/images/malware_2/basic_shell_caught.png)  


It was however, only a basic reverse https shell, and the real test would be calling back to my Cobalt Strike instance.  

With slight nervousness I again ran my script, this time feeding it a raw payload generated from Cobalt Strike, and....  

![uShallNotPassMeme](/assets/images/malware_2/gandalf_boi.jpeg)  

It was caught by the EDR! However this time it was not as simple as a static analysis, it was flagged by the Machine Learning layer of the EDR.
After some asking around it was clear that I had tripped over a _faux pas_, in that I was using the *DEFAULT* Cobalt strike profile, meaning the shellcoding signature was highly recognisable.  

I made use of a [tool](https://github.com/threatexpress/random_c2_profile) that creates a randomised Cobalt Strike profile and started my Cobalt Strike server again.  

![Cobalt_strke_random_profile](/assets/images/malware_2/cobalt_strike.png)  

I generated a raw payload in Cobalt Strike and once again fedit to my Python Script (It is worth noting that a raw payload generated with the "Windows Executable" package options STILL gets caught)

![Beacon](/assets/images/malware_2/beacon.png)  

HUZZUH! The beacon called back, and after blood, sweat, and tears on my first EDR bypass it all came together. And I could ring my grandma and let her know! (she has no idea what I'm talking about)  

This project bestowed me with a depth of understanding I never thought I would possess - and the exciting thing is that I have not even scratched the surface.  

For my third blog entry we will explore custom C2 profiles as well as [Halo's Gate](https://blog.sektor7.net/#!res/2021/halosgate.md).  

But for now, I need to decompress, as the OSEP labs open up for me tomorrow, and it will be back to the grind.
