This assignment will see us generate and examine 3 msfvenom payloads.

We know that for the purpose of this assignment they need to be x86 linux, so we'll start by listing all such payloads with ```msfvenom --list payloads | grep linux/x86```

All our previous tasks so far have dealt with spawning a shell of some sort, so today we will look for something different.

```
    linux/x86/adduser               Create a new user with UID 0
    linux/x86/chmod                 Runs chmod on specified file with specified mode
    linux/x86/exec                  Execute an arbitrary command

```
#### Payload 1

Let's start with ```linux/x86/adduser```:

We spin it up and generate the shellcode for our heavily utilised C wrapper as below:

#### Payload 2

![chmod](/assets/images/SLAE_5/2.JPG)

#### Payload 3

As we can see for the ```linux/x86/exec``` payload, this has only one option, "CMD" - self explanatory.

![exec2](/assets/images/SLAE_5/11.JPG)

For this payload we will use gdb.
As we compiled the payload with the shellcode stored in "code", we know that we can run `disassemble &code` straight off the bat and break just before the interrupt is called, by examining the initial code we clearly see that /bin/sh-c is pushed on - but where does ls come from? it appears the `ins` instruction inputs into a memory location, and as below screenshots, we can determine by breaking at the call instruction and stepping through it while examining the stack that it is indeed pushing that address onto the stack after storing the string inside.

```
   0x0804a040 <+0>:	push   0xb ; move the value of 11 onto stack, the execve syscall number
   0x0804a042 <+2>:	pop    eax ; pop sycall into eax
   0x0804a043 <+3>:	cdq    
   0x0804a044 <+4>:	push   edx ; push 0x0 on (value confirmed by breaking at this address and examining edx)
   0x0804a045 <+5>:	pushw  0x632d push "c-" onto stack (-c)
   0x0804a049 <+9>:	mov    edi,esp ; move args into edi
   0x0804a04b <+11>:	push   0x68732f ; push "hs/" onto stack (/sh)
   0x0804a050 <+16>:	push   0x6e69622f ; push /nib/ (/bin)
   0x0804a055 <+21>:	mov    ebx,esp ; move args into ebx
   0x0804a057 <+23>:	push   edx
   0x0804a058 <+24>:	call   0x804a060 <code+32> ; store ls on the stack
   0x0804a05d <+29>:	ins    BYTE PTR es:[edi],dx store ls inside 0x0804a05d
   0x0804a05e <+30>:	jae    0x804a060 <code+32>
   0x0804a060 <+32>:	push   edi
   0x0804a061 <+33>:	push   ebx
   0x0804a062 <+34>:	mov    ecx,esp
   0x0804a064 <+36>:	int    0x80
   0x0804a066 <+38>:	add    BYTE PTR [eax],al

```
