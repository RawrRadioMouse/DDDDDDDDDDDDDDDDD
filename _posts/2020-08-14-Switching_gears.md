# As I take a sip of my coffee and fire up my vms for another day of windows exploit development I receive a link...

I am towards the end of the CTP material and have a plan to prepare for my upcoming exam, for the better part of six months I have been learning assembly, shellcoding and exploit development techniques to prime me for the OSCE exam.

There was a very recent [announcement](https://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/retiring-ctp-intro-new-courses/) by Offsec that the CTP curse (and essentially) the certification will be RETIRED and replaced with a new, renamed certification that will require the completion of three courses (GG wallet) including the Advanced Web Attacks and Exploitation and two other as-yet unreleased courses which will cover Advanced Penetration testing and Windows exploit development.

After reading through this and considering my options I have decided to complete my last two modules and head straight for the AWAE. Why? because as much as I would love to earn an OSCE, a legacy certification simply does not appeal to me and I have had much of my motivation sapped with this news.

This puts me in an interesting sposition, as the last 6 or so months have been spent preparing for entirely different subject matter, and I now have to switch gears to hard Web Exploitation.

I have accumulated enough knowledge and notes that by the time the new courses roll out I should be in a good position to power through the material (I hope), but for now I need to get B-U-S-Y as I have a lot of new information to cram into my brain.
